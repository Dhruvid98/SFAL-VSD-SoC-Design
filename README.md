# SFAL-VSD SoC Design Program
Welcome to the repository documenting my journey through the SoC Design. This repository documents my hands-on progress, key takeaways, and daily explorations in digital hardware design. It covers topics from tool installation to advanced SoC design and implementation.

| Day       | Topic                                                                  |       Key Takeaway       |
