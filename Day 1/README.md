# Day 1: Functional Verification and Synthesis of 2x1 MUX. 

## Introduction to simulator Iverilog and GTKWave. 
* **Iverilog** is an open-source simulator tool used to verify whether an RTL design adheres to the specified requirements by simulating the design's functionality.
* **GTKWave** is used to view the waveform.
* Iverilog based simulation flow

## Process
**Step 1** : Passing RTL desing and corresponding testbench to Iverilog simulatator
**Step 2** : Generating vcd(value change dump) file
**Step 3** : Visualizing the variables dumping into a VCD file with GTKwave
