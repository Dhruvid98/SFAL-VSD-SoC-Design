# Library Cell Design and Characterization Flows

## Cell Design and Characterization
* In integrated circuit, a **library** is a collection of standard cells defined by parameters such as size, functionality, threshold voltage, and other physical properties. These libraries are essential to the ASIC flow, supporting synthesis, placement, and timing analysis.
* A library consists of different drive strengths of the standard cell.

### Inputs for cell design 
* Process Design kits (PDKs)
* DRC and LVS rules
* SPICE models
* Library (e.g., cell height, supply voltage, number of metal layers, pin locations, drawn gate length etc)
* User-defined specs
