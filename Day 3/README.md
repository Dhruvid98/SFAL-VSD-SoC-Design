# Combinational and Sequential Optimization 

## Introduction to Optimization 
### Combinational Optimization
* Why does the combination logic need optimization?
  - Mainly to squeeze the logic into the most optimized design.
  - Optimized designs are efficient in terms of *Area and Power* saving.


* Techniques for optimization:-
    - Constant Propagation
        * Directly simplifying logic paths when input constants are known

    - Boolean logic optimization
        * K- Map ((Karnaugh Map))
        * Quine McKluskey Algo.
