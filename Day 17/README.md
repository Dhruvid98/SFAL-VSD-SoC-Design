# Day 17: Static Behavior Evaluation: CMOS Inverter Robustness and Noise Margin

Introduction to Noise Margin:
* Noise margin is the amount of noise that a CMOS circuit could withstand without any logical errors.

Based on the above graph, the following points can be inferred
* Any input voltage level between 0 and VIL, the output voltage will be high
* Any input voltage level between VIH and Vdd, the output voltage will be low
* In an ideal case, an inverter with infinite slope switches abruptly at Vdd/2. Whereas practical inverters have a finite slope, creating a **transition region**.
