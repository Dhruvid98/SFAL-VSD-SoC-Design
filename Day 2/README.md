# Day 2: Timing libs, hierarchical vs flat synthesis and efficient flop coding styles

## Introduction to .lib file
* .lib file is a collection of standard cells. 
* Libraries are characterized based on PVT (Process, voltage, temperature)
- Process: Variation is due to fabrication
  * Process corners:- TT (typical), SS (Slow), FF (Fast)
- Voltage: Variation is due to a voltage
- Temperature: Variation due to temperature
Example of PVT by using below file name.
*tt* stands for typical in the .lib name
*025C* stands for temperature of 25 C in the .lib name
*1v80* stands for voltage of 1.8V in the .lib name
