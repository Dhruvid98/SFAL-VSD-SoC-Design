# Day 2: Timing libs, hierarchical vs flat synthesis and efficient flop coding styles

## Introduction to .lib file
* .lib file is a collection of standard cells. 
* Libraries are characterized based on PVT (Process, voltage, temperature)
- Process: Variation is due to fabrication
  *Process corners:- TT (typical), SS (Slow), FF (Fast)
- Voltage: Variation is due to a voltage
- Temperature: Variation due to temperature
